The proudest achievement for me is-
In one of the project, for searchin location, was using geocode and places textsearch google apis.
Which was returning all possible results matching with that text, which was causing bringing unnecessary
locations as well. Costing was too high as those were frequently happening calls.

I have implemented autocomplete google api by replacing existing api so when you will search for location,
it will give you autocomplete options from where you can choose specific result so it was more accurate
as you are initially selecting specific location which you want to select. 
It helped in project costing as well as autocomplete api is less expensive compared to geocode and textsearch api.
